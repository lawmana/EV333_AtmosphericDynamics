    "# Lab 0: Colorado Springs Weather & Climate Data Analysis & Visualization\n",
    "\n",
    "This lab explores weather data from April 1948 through December 2022 collected at the Colorado Springs Municipal Airport (station 051778, 38.80949$^\\circ$N, 104.6887$^\\circ$W). Weather data from this station, at an elevation of 6,182 ft, is one of the longest observational records in the area. The data was accessed from the [Colorado Climate Center](https://climate.colostate.edu/data_access_new.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "First you will analyze monthly and seasonal variations in minimum and maximum temperature, prcipitation, and snowfall. Then you will  calculate annual averages and explore long-term trends. All code and figures will be generated in this Jupyter Notebook using the Python programming language. Please use comments (the `#` symbol) to organize your code and make it more readable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Learning to code requires patience and practice. **This lab is an opportunity to practice new Python skills without the pressure of receiving a point score. Your submission will instead receive a satisfactory/unsatisfactory completion grade.** The purpose of this assignment is to help prepare you for the other graded lab assignments. \n",

    "To foster a collaborative learning environment, you are encouraged to work in groups of 2-3, but each person must write and submit their own code, and individually answer all interpretation questions. All students must complete all problems - it is against the honor code to divide the problems up among different individuals. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Prior to submitting your lab, please name your Notebook file using the following syntax: *LastName_FirstName_EV333_Lab0.ipynb.*\n",

    "- Time series analysis\n",
    "- Statistical analysis\n",

    "- Data visualization with Matplotlib\n",

The DataFrame contains monthly averages of minimim and maximum temperature (in $^\\circ$F), precipitation (in inches), and snowfall (in inches) from 1948-2022. Each column of data is a Series.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this lab is to practice manipulating and plotting the data, so the pre-processing steps are completed for you. Carefully go through each line of code to make sure you understand it. The processed `df` DataFrame is displayed. "

    "Which month *on average* has the highest maximum temperatures? Which month has the most rain? What about the most snow? Can you easily answer this based on the time series plots? The answer is *probably not*. There is over 70 years of data and there are year-to-year fluctuations. It's hard to tell based on the time axis. Instead, we can calculate the average January value, the average February value, the average March value, ..., etc. The average month-to-month changes throughout the year is the average seasonal cycle, or the climatology.\n",
